# Kite-city

Kite city is a collection of service apps developed as a one stop solution for safety and entertainment solution in a smart city. Developed as a part of HackIIIT-Delhi, both the apps are developed using ionic framework.

1. ## Transportation
  This app helps the users in a smart city to travel from one place to another more easily. The app provides the user with the best route from one place to another with the least crowd.
  Unlike google maps this tries to provide the details about the crowd over the streets. 
  
2. ## VR Experience
  This app uses the 360 degrees camera installed in the smart city to provide real time VR experience for the user. This app has potential scope in the field og security as the guards can directly jump into the field of crime instead of just seeing a camera footage.
  The other scope for this app is for traveling. If a user wants to visit a place for example let take it as tajmahal. So insted of going there to find out about the place he/she can direclty put on his VR and use the app to have an eperience of the place and decide accordingly.
